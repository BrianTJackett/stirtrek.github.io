# Stir Trek Attendee Handbook
<div class="icon-hr"></div>

Hi, and welcome to the awesome that makes up Stir Trek.  This Handbook should have the answers you need to successfully navigate the rapids leading up to and right on through the big event in May.  Even if you've been to Stir Trek before, things may have changed.  This Attendee Handbook is your best source for up-to-the-minute guides on what to do and where to go.  Check back periodically for updates as well, as we'll be answering Frequently Asked Questions as they come up.

If for some reason, this guide does not answer a question you may have, here are a couple resources that you can use to get answers:

* [info@stirtrek.com](mailto:info@stirtrek.com)
* [Stir Trek on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/StirTrek)
