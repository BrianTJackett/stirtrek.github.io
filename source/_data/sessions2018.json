      "description": "Machine learning is beginning to have a major impact on software development for all platforms and industries. However a life of developing software in a traditional explicit manner is not the best training for developing machine learning algorithms. Software developers faced with problems like \"What is in this image\", \"Is image a face and is it smiling?\", or \"Is this a hot dog?\" would face much difficulty without a machine learning algorithm approach.\r\n\r\nThis session explains what a neural network is in simple terms. That definition is expanded to include Convolutional Neural Networks and why they are great for image recognition. A sample neural network implemented in Keras and trained with the MNIST dataset will be demostrated to recognize handwritten digits. This session will conclude with an sample iOS application using CoreML to run the neural network directly on a phone and recognize digits in real time.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this session with some ideas on how to begin to approach problems best solved with machine learning algorithms.",

One may think having unit tests to increase code coverage is the goal but that is missing the mark.  Software engineers should be focused on delivering unit tests that have meaningful value to support current and future software development.  In this session, you will learn several unit test styles, how identify weaknesses in unit tests, and how increase the value of the unit tests you create.",

Or thought about why emojis are so popular?\r\n\r\nIn today's day and age we are easily distracted by digital and social media. We have a constant need to stay connected. We are checking our emails more frequently than ever, daily we lookup viral videos on you tube, or read the most re-tweeted tweet, or are curious about how many \"likes\" our last Facebook post/picture has received. The side effect of all this is that we now have an attention span of a gnat.\r\n\r\nHow is this impacting our ability to effectively communicate at our workplace? Are we able to stay brief in our written and verbal communication and convey the message without losing our audience? This lack of effective communication is costing organizations millions of dollars due to reduced productivity, lack of clarity in direction and missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the lost art of communicating in a lean manner. Attendees will walk away with tips and tricks that will make their written and verbal communication 'leaner' and 'crispier' helping them communicate effectively.",

These are all qualifying cases of poor vision, but low vision is more complicated than the prescription of glasses or contacts.\r\n\r\nAccording to the World Health Organization, they categorize low vision based on specific levels of visual acuity and field of vision (W3.org, 2016). With that in mind, we as developers can look at different categories of low vision including color vision, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, etc and make an effort to bake in things like zoom, non-conflicting colors, and re-wrapping of columns in to our code.\r\n\r\nMy talk will cover what vision accessibility is, different categories of low vision, what the needs of the users are, and what we as developers can do to achieve a great user experience for low vision users.",

They are all well known IT organizations that practice continuous delivery and deployment (CDD). This helps them reduce the risk associated with releasing code, improve system resiliency, and reduce overall software development costs. At any point and often multiple times per day, they deploy the latest changes to their production environment with full confidence because their builds have been tested automatically. In this session you will learn how to continuously deliver with confidence. You will learn how to set up a development pipeline for a sample application. Step by step, individual tasks will be assembled and linked together to form a pipeline that takes a code change from source control all the way to a live production environment. But a pipeline is just the start. Along the way you will learn how you can use feature toggles, fast failures, small changes, and optimized tests to encourage a culture of CDD right now.​",

LINQ and Entity Framework are both commonly used in the .Net ecosystem, but even well-written applications can have LINQ queries that are difficult to understand. Because LINQ is so flexible, it can be written in ways that fail to communicate the developer’s intent. Well-written LINQ should be so clear as to be self-documenting. To write clear LINQ, it helps to understand the details of a few LINQ components that improve LINQ’s readability.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be learning how to use a pipe and filter pattern to make LINQ queries easier to comprehend. We will take a deep dive into expression trees to understand how they work, and how to manipulate them for maximum re-usability.",

Often times, when we miss the mark, it is due to a communication breakdown between the developer team and the client team on what the actual requirements are.\r\n\r\nCommunication breakdowns generally occur between people with different communication styles. So how do we bridge that gap and get the information we need from people who communicate differently than we do?\r\n\r\nThis talk will be an exploration of communication styles and how we can recognize our own communication style as well as easily determine the communication style of others. With this information we can communicate with someone in the style in which they best receive information. When we communicate with others in their learning style, we break down barriers and are more able to accurately get to the pain points that they need a solution for. Once the communication barriers are down, it becomes easier to get the requirements that we are looking for.\r\n",

The numerous built-in challenges has made controlling the browser difficult compared to the other popular web options. The release of Microsoft Edge with Windows 10 meant Internet Explorer would slowly decline in usage, but the new browser poses difficulties of its own. The initial limited support for the Edge DriverServer meant the capabilities of browser automation were lacking. Additionally, the userbase who converted over to Windows 10 took their favorite browser with them. In this talk, we’ll demonstrate the problems & solutions for test automation on Windows 10 with Edge, complete with a setup that allows automation developers to switch between Edge, Internet Explorer, and other popular browsers for the same test.\r\n\r\n",

The Information Security Practice Principles, developed by Indiana University’s Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research, provide both a foundation for application security independent of specific technology decisions as well as a means for establishing a common language between designers and defenders. You'll leave this session with a process for building security in depth into your application architecture, using a human-centered user experience design, threat modeling, partitioning, defense in depth, and static analysis in continuous integration. Not yet another checklist, you'll learn how to make security the foundation on which the rest of your application is built.",

However, this type of dysfunction is not usually the fault of any one person or group of people on the team but is the result of the team's inability to recognize and deal with a needed change in a positive and healthy way. In this interactive discussion, you will use the latest in behavioral change modeling to learn how to identify the stages of change. You will come to understand and leverage the decisional balance shifts at each stage. You will discover ways to help people move forward in modifying unwanted behaviors in a healthy way. And, most importantly, you will find out how to support people in maintaining those behavior changes into the future. This session will give you the tools you need to help move a team from dysfunctional to functional without having to remove a single head. ",

If you need to add your business logic to any of the methods or create your own methods, you can do that by writing simple JavaScript functions.  Once you are ready to implement security, Sails provides policies that can be applied to any REST action to implement email/password, social login or Windows authentication.  For data storage,  Sails bundles the power ORM, Waterline, which provides a simple data access layer that just works, no matter which one of the more than 30 data storage providers you are using.   \r\n \r\nThis talk will be code heavy as we walk through getting started with Sails and demonstrate how to implement the features of Sails through the creation of an API.

Serverless computer is the abstraction of servers, infrastructure, and operating systems and make getting solutions to your customer’s needs much quicker and cheaper.  During this session we will look at how Azure Functions will enable you to run code on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.",
